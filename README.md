The project is designed to be easily customizable.

-   **Colors:** To change the color scheme, simply edit the CSS variables defined at the top of the `style.css` file in the `:root` selector.

    ```css
    :root {
        --bg-color: #121212; /* Background */
        --primary-text: #E0E0E0; /* Main text color */
        --gold-accent: #D4AF37; /* Accent color for titles and borders */
        --card-bg: rgba(30, 30, 30, 0.5); /* Glass card background */
        --card-border: rgba(212, 175, 55, 0.2); /* Glass card border */
    }
    ```

-   **Fonts:** The font can be changed by updating the `@import` URL from Google Fonts at the top of `style.css` and changing the `font-family` property in the `body` selector.
