        <p>
          I'm a passionate Website Developer and Cloud Engineer with a unique journey from the banking world into tech. Over the years, I've designed and built multiple responsive websites that blend creativity with functionality — helping businesses grow their online presence with style and precision.

          My curiosity for innovation led me deeper into cloud computing, where I earned AWS certifications and gained real experience deploying secure, scalable solutions. Now, I'm advancing toward becoming a Full Stack Cloud Developer, combining frontend design, backend logic, and cloud technology to create digital experiences that are beautiful, fast, and reliable.
        </p>
        <br></br>

          Whether it's crafting sleek, responsive websites or architecting secure, cloud-powered applications, I'm driven by one goal: building solutions that make an impact.
